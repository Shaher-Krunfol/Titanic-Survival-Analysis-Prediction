# Overview
This project explores the Titanic dataset to identify key survival factors and apply logistic regression to predict passenger outcomes. It includes data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and model evaluation.

##  Contents
- Titanic.ipynb: Full analysis and model notebook
- titanic-dataset.csv: Original Dataset

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Correlation heatmap and survival insights
- Logistic Regression model with performance evaluation
- Interpretation of results and feature impact

## Model Performance
- Accuracy: ~74%
- Precision (Survived): 69%
- Recall (Survived): 62%
Model trained using scikit-learn on selected features

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## What I learned
